# Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in variables
principal_amount = 1000 
rate_of_interest = 5     # example rate of interest in percent
time_in_years = 3        # time in years

# Calculate Simple Interest
simple_interest = (principal_amount * rate_of_interest * time_in_years) / 100

# Output the Simple Interest
print(simple_interest)
